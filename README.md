# Bower

[Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) integration for your ruby apps.

## Usage with Sprockets

### Rails

Add `bower` to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bower'
```

Rails 4 ships with an updated version of Sprockets that supports bower's `component.json` file. If you are running, Rails 3, then you need to require Sprockets [`2.2.2.backport1`](http://rubygems.org/gems/sprockets/versions/2.2.2.backport1):

```ruby
gem 'sprockets', '2.2.2.backport1'
```

The gem includes a generator that will install a `.bowerrc` file to your projects root directory and will configure bower's components to be installed in `components/` which will be automatically added to the Asset Pipeline's asset paths. The gem also includes rake tasks for installing and updating components. So you can modify `components/component.json` then use bower as you would in any other project.

### Non-Rails Projects

While offering less capability than when used in Rails' asset pipeline, you can still use the `bower` gem in a non-Rails project. Just require the gem and append the corresponding directory to Sprocket's load path:

```ruby
require 'sprockets'
require 'bower'

environment = Sprockets::Environment.new
environment.append_path Bower.environment.directory
```

## How this gem differs from other techniques

For Rails apps, integrating components into `lib/assets` and/or `vendor/assets` seems like the wrong approach. Since bower can support multiple searchpaths, the need to make distinction between external dependencies and frameworks does not exist. It can all be managed using bower. Instead, this gem's setting install components to `components/` in your project's root.

## TODO

When used with Sprockets, you still need to use a `require` directive in order to require a component's files. This seems like something that should just work.
